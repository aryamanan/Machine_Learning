# Data Preprocessing

- The Process of cleaning, transforming, and organizing raw data to make it suitable for analysis.
- It involves several steps, including Data Cleaning, Data Transformation, and Data integration.

### Why is it needed?
- Raw data often contains inconsistencies, errors, missing values, and noise that can make it difficult or impossible to analyze.
- Preprocessing helps to clean, transform, and organize data in a way that makes it suitable for analysis.

### Requirements and necessities:
- `Data quality`: Preprocessing requires high-quality data that is free of errors, inconsistencies, and missing values.
- `Data understanding`: It's important to understand the characteristics of the data before preprocessing, such as data types, distributions, and relationships.
- `Data cleaning`: This step involves removing or correcting errors, inconsistencies, and missing values in the data.
- `Data transformation`: This step involves converting the data into a format that is suitable for analysis, such as scaling, normalizing, or encoding categorical variables.
- `Data integration`: This step involves combining data from multiple sources and resolving any inconsistencies or conflicts.
- `Data reduction`: This step involves reducing the size of the data by selecting relevant features or instances.
